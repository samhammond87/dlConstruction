## **User Stories**

**The Owner**

![docs/adminIcon.png](docs/adminIcon.png)

The owner and his management team are hard workers that have brought the company great success. Unfortunately, they lack the proper time to deal with employee paperwork, pay and communication.

**As the owner, I want to**

- View and approve all employee timesheets in one place so that I don't have to rifle through texts and emails.
- Receive the total work hours for each employee so I don't have to calculate it manually.
- I want to be able to distinguish between the work hours that have been paid, and those that are still pending.
- Create logins for new employees so that they can log their own hours.
- Delete logins when an employee leaves the company so that they no longer have access to the dashboard.
- Make announcements on the dashboard to allow all employees to be contacted so I don't have to contact them individually.

**The Client**

![docs/customerIcon.png](docs/customerIcon.png)

D & L Constructions clients live all across Sydney. Anyone who is currently building in Sydney is a potential client, they have the time to shop-around and are constantly looking for the best work at the cheapest price.

**As a potential client, I want to**

- Discover more about the business to gauge if the company holds a high standard of quality.
- Learn the range of services offered.
- See past projects so I know what my end product will look like.
- Contact the business to get a quote or ask a question.

**The Employee**

![docs/employeeIcon.png](docs/employeeIcon.png)

D & L Constructions have both employees and contractors. They are experienced tradespeople who's strengths have allowed them to succeed in a competitive industry. However, their work is hard and once they've left the site the last thing they want to do is fill out more paperwork once they get home.

**As an employee, I want to**

- Submit a timesheet with minimal effort so I don't have to waste time once I'm already at home
- Know the status of my logged timesheets so that I can keep track of my finances.
- View any potential work that is on offer for full-time or contract positions.

#### At a minimum use the following technologies:

- Rails âœ…
  - Used to build backend API
- React.js âœ…
  - Used to build frontend components

### R2

#### Write well designed code that:

- Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern âœ…
  - Different components that make up the entire application are separated into individual folder and file (including styling) according to its function and features
  - E.g. nav bar has its own folder called 'Navbar' that stores the JavaScript and styling files
- Demonstrates DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles âœ…
  - Code reviews have been performed regularly throughout the development process to sure the DRY principle is applied
- Uses appropriate libraries âœ…
