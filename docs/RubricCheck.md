#### At a minimum use the following technologies:

- Rails ✅
  - Used to build backend API
- React.js ✅
  - Used to build frontend components

### R2

#### Write well designed code that:

- Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern ✅
  - Different components that make up the entire application are separated into individual folder and file (including styling) according to its function and features
  - E.g. nav bar has its own folder called 'Navbar' that stores the JavaScript and styling files
- Demonstrates DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) coding principles ✅
  - Code reviews have been performed regularly throughout the development process to sure the DRY principle is applied
- Uses appropriate libraries ✅
  - A variety of libraries have been utilised to develop the app (see further details below)
- Demonstrates good code flow control for user stories ✅
  - Utilising Agile project management methodology
  - Features and functionality of the app are developed according to planned user stories during the planning phase of the project to ensure the best user experience is achieved
- Applies Object Oriented (OO) principles/patterns ✅
  - Due to the declarative, component-based and learn once, write anywhere characteristics of React framework, Object Oriented principles is easily implemented to ensure the code is DRY and reusable
- Uses appropriate data structures ✅
  - Different data structures were considered and discussed during the planning phase, to ensure the appropriate data structures are used

### R3

#### Employ and utilise proper source control methodology (git) ✅

### R4

#### Demonstrate your ability to work in a team: ✅

[Trello](https://trello.com/b/rDfOx3BL/t3a2-b-d-l-construction-part-b)

- Use a recognised project management methodology ✅

  - Trello is used extensively throughout the development process; the board is reviewed daily at our morning team meeting (including weekends)

- Use a recognised task delegation methodology ✅
  - Tasks are assigned to each collaborator according to strengths and weaknesses
  - Throughout the entire process, newly acquired knowledge is shared among team members

### R5

#### Produce a working application that meets client and user needs ✅

- The client, Nick (company owner) is communicated with regularly to ensure app is built to meet business and internal staff needs
- Production site is tested by the client and approval has been received

### R6

#### Deploy the application to a cloud hosting service ✅

The end product is deployed to two cloud hosting services: Netlify (web app) and Heroku (backend API):
